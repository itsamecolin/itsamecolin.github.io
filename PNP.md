# My PNP Showcase

## Introduction

As my **PNP** (Project and Portfolio) comes to a close, it's time to reflect on the journey and share the exciting projects, skills, and learning experiences I've had throughout this period. Over the past few months, I've had the chance to experiment with various tools, learn new software, and produce prototypes that I'm proud of.

### What I Did

#### **Used New Tools**

One of the most exciting parts of this project was using **new tools** that I had never worked with before:

- **3D Printer**: I learned how to design and print 3D models using **Fusion 360** and **Onshape**. My first print was a **custom keychain** that I designed from scratch. It was amazing to see my design come to life in the real world.

- **Laser Cutter**: I also worked with a **laser cutter** to create a set of **custom wooden coasters**. This required me to carefully prepare the design in **Illustrator**, ensuring everything was to scale. The laser cutter allowed me to cut intricate designs into the wood, which was a fantastic experience.

#### **Learned New Software Capabilities**

A big part of my learning journey involved mastering new software tools:

- **Fusion 360**: I learned how to create 3D models, design assemblies, and run simulations in **Fusion 360**. It was challenging at first, but I now feel confident using it to design more complex models.

- **Onshape**: Another software I explored was **Onshape**, a cloud-based CAD tool. This software was new to me, but it quickly became a go-to platform for collaborative design, allowing me to work on projects with others and share designs in real time.

#### **Creative Problem-Solving**

Throughout the project, I encountered multiple **creative problem-solving** opportunities:

- **SVG vs DXF vs Fusion Text**: One of the challenges I faced was managing text and logos across different file types (SVG, DXF, Fusion files). At first, I struggled with ensuring that the text remained legible and properly formatted across various software, but after experimenting, I figured out the best way to import, scale, and adjust text in each format.

#### **Iterated on Designs**

Design iteration was crucial to the success of my projects. I started with basic designs and constantly refined them based on testing, feedback, and visual improvements.

- **Prototyping**: I created a **prototype lamp design** using a combination of 3D-printed parts and laser-cut components. Initially, the lamp was too bulky, but through multiple iterations, I was able to optimize the design, reducing its size while maintaining stability and function.

#### **Produced Prototypes**

In addition to learning new tools and software, I also focused on **producing physical prototypes** to test and validate my designs:

- **Wooden Coasters**: As mentioned, I used the laser cutter to produce prototypes of custom wooden coasters. I iterated on the design, testing different engravings and sizes before finalizing the best version.

### Key Learnings

Throughout the project, I learned a variety of technical and soft skills:

- **Technical Skills**: I now have a solid understanding of 3D modeling, laser cutting, and using new software tools. These skills will be invaluable for future projects, and I feel confident tackling even more complex designs.
  
- **Creative Problem-Solving**: The PNP project pushed me to think critically and creatively, especially when dealing with file formats and material limitations.

- **Design Iteration**: I learned the importance of prototyping and iterating on designs to achieve the best possible result. Small changes can make a big difference in functionality and aesthetics.

### Conclusion

The PNP experience has been incredibly rewarding. It gave me the opportunity to learn and grow both as a designer and a creator. I'm proud of the prototypes I've produced and the skills I've acquired, and I look forward to applying these experiences to future projects.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my journey and projects!
