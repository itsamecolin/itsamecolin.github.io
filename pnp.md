# My PNP Showcase

## Introduction

As my **PNP project** comes to a close, here are some reflection, skills, and learning experiences I've had throughout this period. Over the past unit, I've had the chance to experiment with various tools, learn new software, and produce prototypes that I'm proud of.

### What I Did

#### **Used New Tools**

**new tools** that I had never worked with before:

- **ADOBE Illustrator**: I learned how to design using adobe illustrator and that was really nice as before I have never really gotten to show my more creative side of tech innovation as I had little oppurtunitties to showcase that skill

- **Laser Cutter**: I also worked with a **laser cutter** to create a set of custom neutral Webb Nameplate.
  

#### **Learned New Software Capabilities**

A big part of my learning journey involved mastering new software tools:

- **BAMBOO LABS**: I learned how to use Bamboo labs to reduce printing time. This thanks to Thomas for teaching and suffering with and for me
  

#### **Creative Problem-Solving**

Throughout the project, I encountered multiple **creative problem-solving** opportunities:

I went through some formatting issues as the 3D printer and Laser cutter did not have the capabillities to print my design due to the sizing and font.

### Conclusion

The PNP experience has been incredibly rewarding. It gave me the opportunity to learn and grow both as a designer and a creator. I'm proud of the prototypes I've produced and the skills I've acquired, and I look forward to applying these experiences to future projects.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my journey and projects!
