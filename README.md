Welcome to my website where I will be publishing future projects.
Hi my name is Colin I am from Hong Kong and currently living in California, I am a Junior in Highschool and I am excited to share new projects this year.
My inspiration and ambition to work stems from my want to create, improve and innovate already great things. I am thrilled to start my second year in tech sem and my overall goal is to have fun and see what I can create.

# My PNP Showcase

## Introduction  

As my **PNP project** comes to a close, here are some reflection, skills, and learning experiences I've had throughout this period. Over the past unit, I've had the chance to experiment with various tools, learn new software, and produce prototypes that I'm proud of.

### What I Did

#### **Used New Tools**

**new tools** that I had never worked with before:

- **ADOBE Illustrator**: I learned how to design using adobe illustrator and that was really nice as before I have never really gotten to show my more creative side of tech innovation as I had little oppurtunitties to showcase that skill

- **Laser Cutter**: I also worked with a **laser cutter** to create a set of custom neutral Webb Nameplate.
  

#### **Learned New Software Capabilities**

A big part of my learning journey involved mastering new software tools:

- **BAMBOO LABS**: I learned how to use Bamboo labs to reduce printing time. This thanks to Thomas for teaching and suffering with and for me
  

#### **Creative Problem-Solving**

Throughout the project, I encountered multiple **creative problem-solving** opportunities:

I went through some formatting issues as the 3D printer and Laser cutter did not have the capabillities to print my design due to the sizing and font.

### Conclusion

The PNP experience has been incredibly rewarding. It gave me the opportunity to learn and grow both as a designer and a creator. I'm proud of the prototypes I've produced and the skills I've acquired, and I look forward to applying these experiences to future projects.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my journey and projects!

# VR Reasearch Project

As I explore this unit with the VR in the library, more specifically the Metaquest pro. I first had to reasearch what the VR was and how it worked. This can all be seen in my Slide show below.

## Showcase

After Learning more and more about the VR headset I really wanted to become a more hands on expert. This is where I came up with the idea of importing projects from outside of class into the VR world for viewing. This can all be done with the help of Gravity Sketch which is a software which can be accessed with the headset and computer which allow 3D design to flourish. With the projects from blender thanks to students in Media Arts I can transform there design into real life.

### Conclusion

After all this I still believe I have a lot of room to expand my knowledge of the capabilities of VR which can be done by asking experts like Dr.Bikeman and Ms. Billy however for now I want to be able to inspire other students to explore tools like the VR in the library and for me to be able to provide assistance to any students that require assistance.

# Sensor Prototype and Calibration

In our next unit in Tech Sem we work on using the Arduino Kit and the sensor. The first step to this is the calibration. For this particular project we used the GP2Y0A21YK0F (https://global.sharp/products/device/lineup/data/pdf/datasheet/gp2y0a21yk_e.pdf) and used the graph provided to calibrate the sensor. We did this by sketching a power regression in desmos and plugging it into our code. Some struggles that went through was actually finding the which graph to use and also the innacuracy of our plotting. To get through that after coding we did some hands on calibration with a ruler and tried to make it as accurate as possible.

## Adding Stepper Motor

Our next step was to add a stepper motor as our eventual goal by the end of the project is to use the sensor to and be able to generate a 3d model of and object in the digital world. But why are we using a stepper motor? Firstly to get 3d model the sensor must be able to get a full layout of the object. Thus using the stepper motor we can move the object 360 degrees sNo the sensor can see the whole object. The sensor is also stationary so with the stepper motor we can move it around. Honestly a big hardship we had was unscrewing the bit but we got throught that using brute force.

## Jesus Nut

Thanks to Mr. Raus thinking we were able to implement something called a jesus nut to connect the seccond motor and the sensor. This was a little difficult as our initial design was to small which did not allow us to screw the motor fully. This was a quick fast as Patrick and I just changed some measurements around which fitted our stepper motor.

## Assembling

After getting the proper parts and sizing we moved onto the assembling aspect of this project. As seen by the photo below we can see all the parts connected by the Jesus Nut.
