Welcome to my website where I will be publishing future projects.
Hi my name is Colin I am from Hong Kong and currently living in California, I am a Junior in Highschool and I am excited to share new projects this year.
My inspiration and ambition to work stems from my want to create, improve and innovate already great things. I am thrilled to start my second year in tech sem and my overall goal is to have fun and see what I can create.

# My PNP Showcase

## Introduction  

As my **PNP project** comes to a close, here are some reflection, skills, and learning experiences I've had throughout this period. Over the past unit, I've had the chance to experiment with various tools, learn new software, and produce prototypes that I'm proud of.

### What I Did

#### **Used New Tools**

**new tools** that I had never worked with before:

- **ADOBE Illustrator**: I learned how to design using adobe illustrator and that was really nice as before I have never really gotten to show my more creative side of tech innovation as I had little oppurtunitties to showcase that skill

- **Laser Cutter**: I also worked with a **laser cutter** to create a set of custom neutral Webb Nameplate.
  

#### **Learned New Software Capabilities**

A big part of my learning journey involved mastering new software tools:

- **BAMBOO LABS**: I learned how to use Bamboo labs to reduce printing time. This thanks to Thomas for teaching and suffering with and for me
  

#### **Creative Problem-Solving**

Throughout the project, I encountered multiple **creative problem-solving** opportunities:

I went through some formatting issues as the 3D printer and Laser cutter did not have the capabillities to print my design due to the sizing and font.

### Conclusion

The PNP experience has been incredibly rewarding. It gave me the opportunity to learn and grow both as a designer and a creator. I'm proud of the prototypes I've produced and the skills I've acquired, and I look forward to applying these experiences to future projects.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my journey and projects!

# VR Reasearch Project

As I explore this unit with the VR in the library, more specifically the Metaquest pro. I first had to reasearch what the VR was and how it worked. This can all be seen in my Slide show below.

## Showcase

After Learning more and more about the VR headset I really wanted to become a more hands on expert. This is where I came up with the idea of importing projects from outside of class into the VR world for viewing. This can all be done with the help of Gravity Sketch which is a software which can be accessed with the headset and computer which allow 3D design to flourish. With the projects from blender thanks to students in Media Arts I can transform there design into real life.

### Conclusion

After all this I still believe I have a lot of room to expand my knowledge of the capabilities of VR which can be done by asking experts like Dr.Bikeman and Ms. Billy however for now I want to be able to inspire other students to explore tools like the VR in the library and for me to be able to provide assistance to any students that require assistance.

# Sensor Prototype and Calibration

In our next unit in Tech Sem we work on using the Arduino Kit and the sensor. The first step to this is the calibration. For this particular project we used the GP2Y0A21YK0F (https://global.sharp/products/device/lineup/data/pdf/datasheet/gp2y0a21yk_e.pdf) and used the graph provided to calibrate the sensor. We did this by sketching a power regression in desmos and plugging it into our code. Some struggles that went through was actually finding the which graph to use and also the innacuracy of our plotting. To get through that after coding we did some hands on calibration with a ruler and tried to make it as accurate as possible.

## Adding Stepper Motor

Our next step was to add a stepper motor as our eventual goal by the end of the project is to use the sensor to and be able to generate a 3d model of and object in the digital world. But why are we using a stepper motor? Firstly to get 3d model the sensor must be able to get a full layout of the object. Thus using the stepper motor we can move the object 360 degrees sNo the sensor can see the whole object. The sensor is also stationary so with the stepper motor we can move it around. Honestly a big hardship we had was unscrewing the bit but we got throught that using brute force.

## Reflection One

Throughout this first part of this project I worked with Charlie but due to him having to work on his Blue Bird project I was left with no partner. After mingling for a while and just providing as much support to my classmates as possible I ended up working with Patrick in the later portions of the project and his vast knowledge on coding which provided very useful for this project. Personally where I fit in this project was someone who helped with more of the physical components of the project and also as someone who is good at communication, asking questions from other groups like Thomas and Kayden's about things that they were doing better such as microstepping.

## Jesus Nut

Thanks to Mr. Raus thinking we were able to implement something called a jesus nut to connect the seccond motor and the sensor. This was a little difficult as our initial design was to small which did not allow us to screw the motor fully. This was a quick fast as Patrick and I just changed some measurements around which fitted our stepper motor. The picture below is not the Jesus nut but actually the first rendition on how to connect the motor to the sensor.

## Assembly

The picture below is the actual Jesus nut which works by using screws and bolts to connecto the sensors and stepper motors together. This was a very convenient way to get them together however it took a brief while of building for it to complete. Our initial build was a little lazy as after starting up the motor and running the code it kept vibrating which was due to the screws not being tight enough. After tightening the screws it worked better. From that experience I realize how important it is to not be lazy and cut corners especially when working on a project like this.


## Micro Stepping

After the assembly the motor still had little pauses and interuptions so with Mr. Raus's help and other groups we were introduced to microstepping where we implemented a 1/16. This helped the motor to move smoother and have less interuptions while turning.

## Getting Reading

After the assembling of all materials we needed to test the sensor and Patrick who is good with coding was able to get to work and generated a visual representation however it wasn't to accurate and had to many outlier points.

## Fixing Code

After this small set back Patrick and I found away to get rid of the outlier points and also set a maximum radius of 80cm as according to the graph for calibrating the sensor after 80cm the readings become inconsistent. From the photo you can see below this is the objects we scanned and also the data we recieved.

## Reflection

For a final reflection this project and semester their are somethigs that I did good like communicating with other groups to get their insight and also doing more of the hands on stuff such as the actual assembly however their are things I can improve on. The things I want to improve on next semester is learning more of the technical side of tech and innovation seminar such as more work on coding and some more fine tuning on my Cading skill on onshape.


# Stake Holder Project

## Interview
<img width="286" height="429" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-20 132335" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/662c0d43-2309-4ee8-9f14-caa92d7f6ffc" />

I had a quick interview my friend Finn and as we all did and some of the things we talked about were:

•  Lack of Sleep 
• Lack of motivation
• Help with Organization
• Getting a Job
• Athletics and How it conflicts with school

[W Baseline Rd 19.mp3](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24749900/W.Baseline.Rd.19.mp3


## Finding the Problem

Firstly I had to identify the problem which I pin pointed by talking to my stakeholder Finnegan where we identified the problem which was organization. After talking for a while I thought of how under utilized the Webb Planners are and how the Webb athletics on SIS do not have accurate times. 

<img width="731" height="540" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-20 132520" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aa04d43-def8-4527-8507-00d203e6c78f" />

## What 

After identifying the problem I spent the next class working on prototypes where I was just thinking of solutions. I ended up just choosing the medium tech option of a digital planner.

## How

After finalizing the plan I worked heavily on the code. I initially used GitHub to make a website however I switched to Replit which I beleived was more beginner friendly and in all easier for developing my end goal.

### Problems and Challenges

Most of my challenges came with how the Webb classes are formatted into blocks that changes every week so to combat that instead of having periods like other schools I first had to code what the blocks looked like at Webb and them only having three classes a day.

### What is Next

I still want it to be more user friendly for Webb students as currently you still need to input your classes and what block they are. In the future I want the classes to be preset with their locations already available. I also want to find a way where I can add activities in between blocks like chapel, advisory and meetings.
