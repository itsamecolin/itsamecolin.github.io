Welcome to my website where I will be publishing future projects.
Hi my name is Colin I am from Hong Kong and currently living in California, I am a Junior in Highschool and I am excited to share new projects this year.
My inspiration and ambition to work stems from my want to create, improve and innovate already great things. I am thrilled to start my second year in tech sem and my overall goal is to have fun and see what I can create.
