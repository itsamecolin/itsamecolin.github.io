Welcome to my website where I will be publishing future projects.
Hi my name is Colin I am from Hong Kong and currently living in California, I am a Junior in Highschool and I am excited to share new projects this year.
My inspiration and ambition to work stems from my want to create, improve and innovate already great things. I am thrilled to start my second year in tech sem and my overall goal is to have fun and see what I can create.

# My PNP Showcase

## Introduction

As my **PNP project** comes to a close, here are some reflection, skills, and learning experiences I've had throughout this period. Over the past unit, I've had the chance to experiment with various tools, learn new software, and produce prototypes that I'm proud of.

### What I Did

#### **Used New Tools**

**new tools** that I had never worked with before:

- **ADOBE Illustrator**: I learned how to design using adobe illustrator and that was really nice as before I have never really gotten to show my more creative side of tech innovation as I had little oppurtunitties to showcase that skill

- **Laser Cutter**: I also worked with a **laser cutter** to create a set of custom neutral Webb Nameplate.
  

#### **Learned New Software Capabilities**

A big part of my learning journey involved mastering new software tools:

- **BAMBOO LABS**: I learned how to use Bamboo labs to reduce printing time. This thanks to Thomas for teaching and suffering with and for me
  

#### **Creative Problem-Solving**

Throughout the project, I encountered multiple **creative problem-solving** opportunities:

I went through some formatting issues as the 3D printer and Laser cutter did not have the capabillities to print my design due to the sizing and font.

### Conclusion

The PNP experience has been incredibly rewarding. It gave me the opportunity to learn and grow both as a designer and a creator. I'm proud of the prototypes I've produced and the skills I've acquired, and I look forward to applying these experiences to future projects.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my journey and projects!

# VR Reasearch Project

As I explore this unit with the VR in the library, more specifically the Metaquest pro. I first had to reasearch what the VR was and how it worked. This can all be seen in my Slide show below.

## Showcase

After Learning more and more about the VR headset I really wanted to become a more hands on expert. This is where I came up with the idea of importing projects from outside of class into the VR world for viewing. This can all be done with the help of Gravity Sketch which is a software which can be accessed with the headset and computer which allow 3D design to flourish. With the projects from blender thanks to students in Media Arts I can transform there design into real life.
